# DCA Crystal Ball

I'd like to project how much a recession in the next X years would affect investment returns.

The goal is to have some sort of data driven approach for/against dollar cost averaging.

## Getting started:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/actuallymentor/dollar-cost-averaging-crystal-ball.git
cd dollar-cost-averaging-crystal-ball
npm install
npm run simulation
```

Edit the app.js to play with the assumptions or to run more simulations.
