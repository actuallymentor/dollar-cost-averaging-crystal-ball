# DCA Crystal Ball

I'd like to project how much a recession in the next 5 years would affect investment returns.

The plan:

[] Compound interest function ( principal only, yearly return )
[] Compound interest with yearly addition
[] Compound interest with recession option ( yearly )
[] Monthify all the things
