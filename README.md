# DCA Crystal Ball

I'd like to project how much a recession in the next 5 years would affect investment returns.

The plan:

[x] Compound interest function ( principal only, yearly return )
[x] Compound interest with yearly addition
[x] Compound interest with recession option ( yearly )
[] Monthify all the things
